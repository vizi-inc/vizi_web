      <div id ="dusan" class="panel">
        <p>About the same time when games were adopting 3d technology, my family firm got a 3d studio license (before it became MAX). I started playing around in it, and after modeling skateboards and cars I soon started creating 3d models of buildings. After a few projects, our firm started advertising rendering services as well, and I ended up doing work for other architects. Since then I have been recreating built and proposed projects, such as the facade of the De Young museum and the parametric brick wall developed at the ETH. I’ve tried to incorporate these features into my own designs ever since, and I’ve started learning how to code properly. I am currently mostly focused on real-time graphics.

        <p>Eric is a creative coder who gets incredibly excited about all the rich interactive experiences just waiting to be brought into existence. While working as a front end engineer by day, Eric was surprised yet delighted to discover many of his evenings coding webgl turning into intense, all night, passionate hackathons. As he fell more deeply in love with his night work, the days became more and more drab, until he realized he had to devote himself towards his creative work 100%, and left his day job behind.
