        <p>Eric is a creative coder who gets incredibly excited about all the rich interactive experiences just waiting to be brought into existence. While working as a front end engineer by day, Eric was surprised yet delighted to discover many of his evenings coding webgl turning into intense, all night, passionate hackathons. As he fell more deeply in love with his night work, the days became more and more drab, until he realized he had to devote himself towards his creative work 100%, and left his day job behind.
