Using iframes might not be best approach- if you load iframes up on initialization, then the performace is slow. 
If you load and unload them dynamically, performace stutters as it loads, and also thats a lot of info being sent across the wire every time we load them up.


Another issue with iframes we need to discuss is how to deal with the sizing issues

Id like to discuss color scheme- dont know if I like the huge difference in colors between top bar and main 3d page

Top Bar
TEAM TECH PROJECTS CONTACT
(contact can just be mailto: , or form if we have time)

Take out iframes, have them link to full demo in another tab

Animated GIF of the demo would be nice, but screen shot OK

Text labels for top-level items should be on pulleys

Clicking on a top level item should rotate the statue in some way, ideally with the category pane facing the user

You should be able to access the SVG DOM with renderer.domElement

To convert that to XML string (if that is what you mean by "svg text"):

var XMLS = new XMLSerializer(); 
var svgfile = XMLS.serializeToString(renderer.domElement);
