Take out iframes, have them link to full demo in another tab

Animated GIF of the demo would be nice, but screen shot OK

Text labels for top-level items should be on pulleys

How to deal with projects overflowing the left menu?

You should be able to access the SVG DOM with renderer.domElement

To convert that to XML string (if that is what you mean by "svg text"):

var XMLS = new XMLSerializer(); 
var svgfile = XMLS.serializeToString(renderer.domElement);
