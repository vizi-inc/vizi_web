Using iframes might not be best approach- if you load iframes up on initialization, then the performace is slow. 
If you load and unload them dynamically, performace stutters as it loads, and also thats a lot of info being sent across the wire every time we load them up.


Another issue with iframes we need to discuss is how to deal with the sizing issues

Id like to discuss color scheme- dont know if I like the huge difference in colors between top bar and main 3d page
